1. Integrating a deep learning model for image generation into Flask poses challenges in managing model dependencies and ensuring compatibility.
2. Handling large-scale image data and optimizing its transfer between the frontend and backend can be complex and resource-intensive.
3. Balancing real-time performance with the computational demands of image generation presents a delicate trade-off, requiring careful optimization.
4. Implementing secure user inputs for image customization while preventing potential vulnerabilities demands robust input validation and sanitization.
5. Achieving seamless deployment and scaling may involve overcoming deployment-related issues and ensuring consistent performance across different environments.
6. Debugging and troubleshooting issues in the integration of Flask and image generation may require a nuanced understanding of both web development and machine learning components.
